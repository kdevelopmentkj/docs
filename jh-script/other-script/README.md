# Other Script

**The following FiveM scripts are basic versions that will likely require dependencies and additional setup. While they are simple in their intended functionality, they may need specific resources, frameworks (such as ESX, QBCore, etc.), or other dependencies to work properly on your FiveM server. Make sure to check the requirements and install any necessary components before implementing these scripts.**
