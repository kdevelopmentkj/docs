# XScript

**The X-series scripts (Extended) are completely independent, high-quality scripts designed to fulfill very specific functions or demands. Unlike basic scripts, these are extensively developed and refined to perfection to address unique problems or requirements.**

**For example, Xcars manages player vehicles by removing the need for traditional references like license plates or other limiting identifiers that aren't optimal and restrict other scripts (especially when plates change, etc.). Instead, it provides much more comprehensive persistence, working alongside its smaller counterparts like JH\_Persistence and future releases.**

**These X-scripts are pushed to the extreme to achieve perfection and solve specific problematics or unique demands. They represent a much higher standard of craftsmanship and functionality compared to standard scripts.**
