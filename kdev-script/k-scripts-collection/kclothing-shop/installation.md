We try our best to have the easyest installation possible, to have a plug and play fivem script :

1. Download the script `kclothshop` from your [CFX Portal](https://portal.cfx.re/assets/granted-assets)
2. Put your script in your resource folder (you can place it anyware, but it must be started after eatch dependencies)
3. Follow the installation guide for `ox_inventory`            &#x20;
